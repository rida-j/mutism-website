				<h1>Join our weekly drop in group coaching services.</h1>
				
				<p>This is an opportunity for parents to connect with one another under the guidance of an SM expert.</p>
				
				<p>The group coaching sessions are personally moderated by Dr. Bork and run every Saturday. Dr. Bork is renowned for her expertise in resolving severe, long standing, and resistant to treatment cases of SM. Not only has she successfully treated her own children while others have failed, she has also resolved many similar cases within hours (not months or years). It is no wonder parents and treating professionals turned to Dr. Bork for help when “nothing is working,” or the “progress is too slow,” or “my child stop progressing.”</p>

				<p>One study conducted by Dr. Bork demonstrated the success in treating children with SM within 130 minutes each of their time using the VSR technique is published in the peer-reviewed paper “Video self-modeling, fading, and reinforcement: An effective treatment of children with selective mutism” in Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry (2019).</p>

					<h3>Workshop</h3>

				<div class="table-box-info">
					<p>	This workshop is designed for anyone who interacts with a child with selective mutism (SM) in a school setting. For instance, principals, teachers, speech-language pathologists, communicative disorders assistants, social workers, child & youth workers, educational assistants, psychologists, custodians, and librarians. Parents and other health care professionals will benefit from attending this as well.</p>
					<p>This workshop presents the most up-to-date resources on SM. These resources include case studies on  etiology, prevalence, effects of SM as well as assessment and treatment approaches. Additionally, participants learn how to set up an inclusive and inviting learning environment, and to provide accommodations for the child in the school.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, participants will learn why some school-based interventions do not work, and why the “VSR” method (coined by Dr. Bork) is the most effective approach for SM intervention.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, Dr. Bork equips participants with the knowledge to develop their own individualized SM intervention based on the VSR technique.</p>

							<p>	What we've observed while talking to and coaching families with a loved one suffering from selective mutism (SM) is that they have invested considerable time and effort in searching for a therapist experienced in treating SM in a timely and cost-effective manner. However, this has often proved challenging. That’s why we've decided to use this platform to connect families with coaches who have personally experienced SM, either themselves or through a loved one. These coaches genuinely understand SM because they have lived through it! If you or someone you know is looking for a coach to guide their family through their SM journey, feel free to look through the list of coaches available at SMF :)</p>

							<p>The Selective Mutism Foundation does not collect coaching fees; we simply facilitate connections within the SM community. SMF is not involved in the coaching sessions and does not guarantee their outcomes. We strongly advise caretakers to seek guidance from healthcare practitioners and other professionals. </p>

							<p>Interested in joining our list of SM coaches? Please review the <a class="link-text-p" href="files/coaching.docx">coaching agreement form</a> for more information!  </p>

I help parents have a firm understanding of what SM is and isn’t, I help find the important first steps to allow the child to begin making progress, I look at the various environments the child is in and help the parents understand what changes to make to set the child up for success, and most importantly, I’m someone who “gets it” – I know how hard this journey is, but I also know how amazing even the smallest of wins feel and I love to celebrate them with parents!</p>

					<p>Living with selective mutism poses significant challenges, regardless of whether you’re a child, teenager, or an adult. The inability to communicate thoughts, ideas, and needs can be extremely debilitating. Based on my personal journey with selective mutism and my experiences as a parent, I’ve observed that it is often difficult for family, friends, teachers, and even some therapists to grasp, which limits their capacity to provide effective support. The reassuring news is that you’re not alone in this journey. You don’t have to navigate life with selective mutism feeling isolated. As an SM coach, my aim is to assist you in overcoming selective mutism by providing tailored support and equipping you with the necessary tools to lead a fulfilling life.</p>
